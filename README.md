**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, while working on the RPEmotes resource with @TayMcKenzieNZ, he had the idea to implement a /binoculars and /newscam command, you can find it implemented here : https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/rpemotes !
However we noticed many people were selling scripts with this feature, so we decided to make a standalone resource for it, and make it free for everyone to use !

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-views` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-views` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, use the command /binoculars or /newscam.

**Features :sparkles: :**
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use
* FREE
* Editable text on the news scaleform


*Demo :eyes:  :*
